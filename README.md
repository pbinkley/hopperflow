==========

A Rails app to help organize a folder full of scanned images into single- 
and multi-paged documents.

The idea is to graft some javascript I wrote for an 
Apache Cocoon app onto a Rails app, to make it more reusable.

The purpose: suppose you're doing archival research. You go to the archives 
and spend a couple of days snapping pictures of documents with your phone,
and you save these pictures into directories that match the physical folders.
Now you're home again and you want to divide those streams of images into 
documents, and provide them with some basic metadata for ingest into a local 
repository of some kind. Some of the images need to be fixed (rotated, split, 
etc.). This app will provide you with a basic interface to organize the images 
into documents, describe them, and do the basic image manipulation.

Work-in-progress, but I've got a few hundred images waiting for processing...
